				"Challenge": "Fans remember the voices as much as the plays yet once games end, that audio disappears into the archive. We wanted to explore how those dormant broadcasts could be transformed into a cultural initiative for the NBA with lasting impact. The concept was a public audio archive: curating historic radio broadcasts into long-form listening experiences, packaged as seasons, series, and iconic runs. The challenge was to prove that game audio, often treated as disposable, could be reframed and positioned as a scalable cultural asset rather than one-off content.",
				"Outcome": "The archive pilot showed how the NBA could position itself not just as live action entertainment, but as a steward of its own cultural memory. For the brand, it transformed dormant broadcasts into a living library of basketball history. For ESPN, it extended their role as the lasting voice of the game, with commentary re-released as curated playlists and podcast-style series. For fans, it created a deeper, more immersive way to relive iconic moments starting from Kobe Bryant’s 2010 championship run. In a format that match today’s long-form listening habits, the real opportunity lay in scale: cross-team pollination, richer appreciation of the league’s heritage, and history."
			},
			"right-column": {
				"My Role": "I led the creative and strategic development of the archive, shaping it from a loose idea into a structured, pitch-ready initiative. I reframed why historic broadcasts matter, designed how they could be curated into seasons, series, and playlists, and articulated how the format connects nostalgia, wellness, and fan engagement. Beyond creative framing, I also mapped the path to execution by outlining how rights clearance, broadcaster coordination, and league approvals could be built into the process without losing momentum. I structured the deck to highlight the benefits for each stakeholder, from brand equity to broadcaster visibility to fan connection, and ensured the idea was positioned as both inspiring and feasible. This project sharpened my ability to transform underused assets into cultural infrastructure, and to translate speculative vision into a framework aligned with real-world approvals and workflows."

				"Challenge": "Cinnabon already holds a place as a bona fide comfort food, a small treat that makes sense for an everyday reward-based indulgence. The challenge was to extend a small, everyday comfort into an “any occasion” campaign, showing what happens when a brand built for little joys tries to solve moments far bigger than it can. The creative task was to lean into that gap and use it as the foundation for humor, turning Cinnabon’s limitations into its cultural voice.",
				"Outcome": "The concept reframed Cinnabon as self-aware and culturally fluent. Instead of pretending a sweet treat could fix heartbreak, layoffs, or tragedy, the campaign made the absurdity the point. By leaning into this mismatch, Cinnabon could step into cultural and social spaces that most brands avoid — the uncomfortable, everyday moments where humor cuts through. In doing so, a brand that usually sits outside of culture found a way to matter: not by overpromising, but by owning its role as comic relief. The result was a scalable platform that pushed the brand’s voice, proved it could tolerate bolder humor, and showed how even a legacy comfort brand can make cultural impact by claiming space other advertisers leave untouched."
			},
			"right-column": {
				"My Role": "I worked with Jason to push how far Cinnabon’s humour tolerance could stretch, co-creating the “for any occasion” platform and developing five scripts designed for commercial production. Together we repositioned the brand from safe indulgence to culturally relevant self-awareness. We structured the scripts to highlight the absurdity of small gestures in big moments, and framed the campaign as a way for a socially quieter brand to claim relevance in spaces other advertisers overlook. This project proved my ability to unearth and own under explored spaces, build humour from human truths, and create scenarios that extend a brand’s voice into new cultural spaces.",

				"Challenge": "If I were leading creative for Sharpie, I would want the brand to move beyond utility and step into cultural relevance. Brands like United Colors of Benetton built entire identities around social and political provocation, using design as a platform for commentary. Sharpie has the same potential. Permanence is not only about ink but about resistance, advocacy, and voice. The challenge was to reimagine Sharpie as a brand that does not just sell a tool, but champions the lasting change that comes from it.",
				"Outcome": "The result was a conceptual campaign called “Permanent Change.” It positioned Sharpie as a tool for activism and self-expression, linking permanence with impact. By focusing on absence; the empty sign, the unfinished poster, the words not yet written - the work underscored Sharpie’s historical place in protest and social movements. It reframed the brand as a symbol of resistance and transformation, and as a creative prompt for broader conversations about how design can participate in cultural change."

				"Outcome": "The new design system met strict regulatory requirements while giving Jack & Jill the polish of a consumer brand. It built trust by communicating legitimacy and safety in a regulated space, increased clarity through a hierarchy and messaging system that reduced confusion at the point of decision, and elevated positioning by creating a cohesive identity that inspired loyalty among patients and confidence in the brand. The result was a scalable framework that worked seamlessly across prescription, OTC, and vitamin lines, enabling Jack & Jill to compete as a credible player in the wellness market."

I worked closely with the pharmacy team to uphold strict compliance standards while still creating a design system that felt approachable and consumer-friendly. The framework was built to scale as Jack & Jill grew, ensuring consistency across product lines and future expansions. This process sharpened my ability to design for regulated industries where clarity and trust are paramount, to translate constraints into creative systems that support business growth, and to elevate consumer perception through packaging that connects brand voice with real-world compliance. These same skills now apply to MedTech, bio, and health companies looking to move from technical credibility to broad public adoption."
